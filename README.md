In this repository you'll find a collection of [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) templates for making [Flyte](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte) projects.

We use cookiecutter's ability to define [multiple templates to be defined in the same repository](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/directories.html). Each cookiecutter template is defined in a separate directory, e.g. the template used in Flyte's [Getting Started](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/getting_started.html) guide lives in a directory called `simple-example`.
