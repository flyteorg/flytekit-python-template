A template for the recommended layout of a Flyte enabled repository for code written in python using [flytekit](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytekit/en/latest/).

## Usage

To get up and running with your Flyte project, we recommend following the
[Flyte getting started guide](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).

We recommend using a git repository to version this project, so that you can
use the git sha to version your Flyte workflows.
